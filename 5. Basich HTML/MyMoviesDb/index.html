        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><span class="site-name">MyMoviesDb</span> is an award-winning website for classic film buffs, students,
            moviegoers and anyone else interested in the great movies of the last century.
            Detailed plot synopses, review commentary and film reference material are just
            some of the features available on the site. The site also contains film analysis,
            original content, information on the top films and most memorable movie scenes,
            "Best of..." articles, and the most popular film quotes in all genres of film.
            Its many resources include a comprehensive overview of film history, a complete
            survey of the Academy Awards (Oscars), milestones and turning points in the industry,
            and background and descriptions for hundreds of classic Hollywood/American and other
            English-language movies from the last one hundred years. In the mid-1990s when it was
            first launched, filmsite.org was one of the first websites to initiate the trend to
            select 100 Greatest Films in the history of cinema.</p>

        <p>About Film Historian Tim Dirks
            Tim Dirks
            Tim Dirks created the popular filmsite.org website, aka Greatest Films, in mid-1996,
            and it celebrated its landmark 20th anniversary in 2016. He has been writing about and
            reviewing films ever since. As of September 2008, the site was acquired by American Movie
            Classics (AMC) LLC, and then as of July 2011, it became part of a new company called AMC Networks,
            Inc. Tim continues to be the sole contributor, manager, and editor of Filmsite - he adds
            significant content to the site spanning all the years of cinematic history, and often writes
            blogs and other film-related articles, including those for Sundance TV's series 1001 Movies
            You Must See Before You Die. The site averages between 30-50 million page views per year (see visitor and
            traffic
            statistics).</p>
